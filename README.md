Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay if the first letter is a vowel, else add "ay" to the complete string, if the first letter is a consonant. So "aython" becomes "ythonpay" or "python" becomes "pythonay". 
To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we'll need to take:
1. Ask the user to input a word in English.
2. Make sure the user entered a valid word.
3. Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
4. Display the translation result.
